1) Organize Code by Purpose
2) Unify behavoir of objects that store an object in dynamic memory.
    - This can be done by...
        i) Creating a copy dynamically (new object(original)) while passing the original one by reference
        ii) Forcing objects to be created dynamically and then passed as an argument.
    - Mostly applies to preset jsons, as I completly lost it when working on the preset support.
3) Update documentation on what a function does.
